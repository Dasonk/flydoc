#' Provide documentation to your functions on the fly
#'
#' This package is a designed to provide an easy way to
#' document your functions on the fly.  If you've defined a function
#' interactively this package will still allow you to provide a help
#' file.  If you have a function stored in a script but don't want to
#' or have the time to create a package for it - this will allow you
#' to still provide some help documentation for those functions.
