Description: This package is a designed to provide an easy way to
    document your functions on the fly.  If you've defined a function
    interactively this package will still allow you to provide a help
    file.  If you have a function stored in a script but don't want to
    or have the time to create a package for it - this will allow you
    to still provide some help documentation for those functions.
